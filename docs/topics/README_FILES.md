# README Files #

This file outlines how a README.md file for a pluggable Carolina app should
look.

It should begin with some a sample YML portion showing how the app can
be included in `config.yml`, with most recommended data options shown with
sane options filled.

It should then have a brief description and then the following sections.

* **Name and Mount Point**: Discuss what your app should be named (in the site configuration) and where it must or should be mounted.
* **Data Options**: Discuss any data options your app takes and how they can be used.
* **Models**: Discuss and document any models exposed by your app.
* **Middleware**: Discuss any shareable express middleware exposed by the app.
* **Templates**: Discuss any reusable templates exposed by the app.
* **Static Files**: Discuss any reusable static files exposed by the app.
* **Interactions**: Discuss any other ways in which programmers may interact with the app.
